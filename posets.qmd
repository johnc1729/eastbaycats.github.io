# Partially Ordered Sets

## The "Divides" Relation

::: {#dfn-2.1}
Let $m$ and $n$ be integers. We say $m$ *divides* $n$, and we write $m \mid n$ if there exists an integer $q$ such that $mq = n$.
:::


For example, $3$ divides $6$ since $3 \cdot 2 = 6$, and $-5$ divides $10$ since $-5 \cdot 2 = 10$.

::: {#exr-2.1}
Show that for any integer $a$ we have $a \mid a$.
:::

This is called *reflexivity*, and we say that $\mid$ is *reflexive* because it satisfies this property. For all that follows, we denote by $\mathbb{N}$ the *natural numbers*, consisting of the non-negative integers $0, 1, 2, \dots$. Take special care to notice that *we are including zero in this set*.[^1] It will soon be apparent why we do this.

Another important note about the "divides" relation is that saying "$a$ divides $b$" is *not* the same as saying "$b$ is divisible by $a$."

[^1]: This differs from another convention that excludes zero, which you may be used to.


::: {#exr-2.2}
Show that for natural numbers $a$ and $b$, if $a \mid b$ and $b \mid a$, then $a = b$.[^2]
:::

[^2]: If we allow $a$ and $b$ to be negative, then the most general statement we can make is that the magnitudes are equal.

If $a \mid b$, then there exists a natural number $k_1$ such that $a k_1 = b$. Similarly, $b \mid a$ implies there exists a natural number $k_2$ such that $b k_2 = a$. Hence, $b = a k_1 = b k_1 k_2$. We may similarly show that $a = k_1 k_2 a$. The first equation tells us that $b (1 - k_1 k_2) = 0$. Then either $b = 0$ or $k_1 = k_2 = 1$.

If $b = 0$, then because $a k_1 = b$ we have either $a = 0$ (and thus $a = b$), or we have $k_1 = 0$. This would imply that $a = k_1 k_2 a = 0 \cdot k_2 a = 0$. So $a = b$.

If $b \neq 0$ (i.e., $k_1 = k_2 = 1$), then certainly $a = 1 \cdot a = k_1 \cdot a = b$. In either case, $a = b$.

::: {#exr-2.3}
Show that if $a$, $b$, and $c$ are integers, and $a \mid b$ and $b \mid c$, then $a \mid c$.
