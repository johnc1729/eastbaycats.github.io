# Partially Ordered Sets

## The "Divides" Relation

::: {#dfn-2.1}
Let $m$ and $n$ be integers. We say $m$ *divides* $n$, and we write $m \mid n$ if there exists an integer $q$ such that $mq = n$.
:::


For example, $3$ divides $6$ since $3 \cdot 2 = 6$, and $-5$ divides $10$ since $-5 \cdot 2 = 10$.

::: {#exr-2.1}
Show that for any integer $a$ we have $a \mid a$.
:::

This is called *reflexivity*, and we say that $\mid$ is *reflexive* because it satisfies this property. For all that follows, we denote by $\mathbb{N}$ the *natural numbers*, consisting of the non-negative integers $0, 1, 2, \dots$. Take special care to notice that *we are including zero in this set*.[^1] It will soon be apparent why we do this.

Another important note about the divides relation 

[^1]: This differs from another convention that excludes zero, which you may be used to.


::: {#exr-2.2}
Show that for natural numbers $a$ and $b$, if $a \mid b$ and $b \mid a$, then $a = b$.
:::

::: {.callout collapse=true}
If $a \mid b$, then there exists a natural number $k_1$ such that $a k_1 = b$. Similarly, $b \mid a$ implies there exists a natural number $k_2$ such that $b k_2 = a$. Hence, $b = a k_1 = b k_1 k_2$. Thus, $b (1 - k_1 k_2) = 0$. Then either $b = 0$ or $k_1 = k_2 = 1$.
:::

::: {#exr-2.3}
Show that if $a$, $b$, and $c$ are integers, and $a \mid b$ and $b \mid c$, then $a \mid c$.

Let $\preccurlyeq$ denote a partial order relation.
