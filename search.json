It’s useful to have the definition on hand, but if one is intimidated by this, then one can informally think of a category as something where we have objects, a way of mapping between those objects (along with an identity map on each object), and a way of composing those maps (where composition is associative). Almost everything in mathematics satisfies these criteria. We’ll see that what can be considered a “map” is fairly flexible, and the ways we might compose those maps can also vary quite a bit.",

    "section": "1.2 Categories as a foundation for mathematics",
    "text": "1.2 Categories as a foundation for mathematics\nThroughout our mathematical education, we have likely encountered many types of mathematical objects (e.g., groups, rings, vector spaces, fields, topological spaces, sets, functions, manifolds). We might have learned that a group is “a set equipped with an associative binary operation having an identity element, and for which every element has an inverse,” or that a “vector space is a set equipped with the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication satisfying the usual axioms.” It may have been a while since we’ve dealt with these definitions, or we may not have learned them at all. That is okay. What is important to focus on now is that both of these objects are defined as a set equipped with some additional structure. We have defined them in terms of “sets.”\nSo what is a “set,” exactly? We might see it defined as “a collection of objects, which are called its elements,” which then begs the question: what is a “collection”? How is it that we can give such precise definitions of all of the structures mentioned above (vector spaces, groups, rings, etc.), yet we seem to have difficulty making precise the concept of a set, on which the definitions of all of these structures rely?\nThe uncomfortable truth is that modern mathematics, with its rigorous definitions and axioms, cannot exist ex nihilo. To formulate a rigorous definition, we must first precisely define each term within that definition, and so on for the definitions of each of those terms. This process cannot end without either defining two objects “circularly,” such that some object is defined in terms of another and vice versa, or declaring once and for all that certain objects are atomic, and they cannot be defined in terms of any other object. This is where sets lie: we do not bother defining what a set is, and instead we focus on the conclusions drawn from a set of axioms we assume to hold about sets.\nWe could do away with set theory, and instead formally define all the mathematical structures above in terms of categories. Thus, categories constitute an alternative foundation for mathematics. But category theory does not bypass the problem of definability. There are still terms which we take as “atomic,” and we do not bother precisely defining them (e.g., the objects and morphisms).",

Meanwhile, \\(0/0\\) is undefined.\nThis property is called transitivity, and we say that \\(\\mid\\) is a transitive relation on the integers.\nFor all that follows, we denote by \\(\\mathbb{N}\\) the natural numbers, consisting of the non-negative integers \\(0, 1, 2, \\dots\\). Take special care that we are including zero in this set.2 It will soon be apparent why we do this.\nThis property is known as antisymmetry, and we say that \\(\\mid\\) is an antisymmetric relation on \\(\\mathbb{N}\\).",

The first equation tells us that \\(b (1 - k_1 k_2) = 0\\).
