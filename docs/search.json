    "text": "2.1 The “Divides” Relation\nFor example, \\(3\\) divides \\(6\\) since \\(3 \\cdot 2 = 6\\), and \\(-5\\) divides \\(15\\) since \\(-5 \\cdot 3 = 15\\).\nThis is called reflexivity, and we say that \\(\\mid\\) is reflexive because it satisfies this property. For all that follows, we denote by \\(\\mathbb{N}\\) the natural numbers, consisting of the non-negative integers \\(0, 1, 2, \\dots\\). Take special care that we are including zero in this set.1 It will soon be apparent why we do this.\nAnother important note about the “divides” relation is that to say “\\(a\\) divides \\(b\\)” is not the same as saying “\\(b/a\\) is an integer.” The latter is a statement about the result of applying the division binary operation to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).2",

We say \\(m\\) divides \\(n\\), and we write \\(m \\mid n\\) if there exists an integer \\(q\\) such that \\(mq = n\\).\n\n\n\nExercise 2.1 Show that for any integer \\(a\\) we have \\(a \\mid a\\).\n\n\n\nSolution\n\nWe have \\(a \\cdot 1 = a\\), so \\(a\\) satisfies Definition 2.1 with \\(1\\) in place of \\(q\\).\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2.2 Show that for natural numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), if \\(a \\mid b\\) and \\(b \\mid a\\), then \\(a = b\\).3\n\n\n\nSolution\n\nIf \\(a \\mid b\\), then there exists a natural number \\(k_1\\) such that \\(a k_1 = b\\). Similarly, \\(b \\mid a\\) implies there exists a natural number \\(k_2\\) such that \\(b k_2 = a\\). Hence, \\(b = a k_1 = b k_1 k_2\\). We may similarly show that \\(a = k_1 k_2 a\\). The first equation tells us that \\(b (1 - k_1 k_2) = 0\\). Then either \\(b = 0\\) or \\(k_1 = k_2 = 1\\).\nIf \\(b = 0\\), then because \\(a k_1 = b\\) we have either \\(a = 0\\) (and thus \\(a = b\\)), or we have \\(k_1 = 0\\). This would imply that \\(a = k_1 k_2 a = 0 \\cdot k_2 a = 0\\). So \\(a = b\\).\nIf \\(b \\neq 0\\) (i.e., \\(k_1 = k_2 = 1\\)), then certainly \\(a = 1 \\cdot a = k_1 \\cdot a = b\\). In either case, \\(a = b\\).\n\n\nExercise 2.3 Show that if \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are integers, and \\(a \\mid b\\) and \\(b \\mid c\\), then \\(a \\mid c\\).",
