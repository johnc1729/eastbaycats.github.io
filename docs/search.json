    "text": "3.1 The “Divides” Relation\nFor example, \\(3\\) divides \\(6\\) since \\(3 \\cdot 2 = 6\\), and \\(-5\\) divides \\(15\\) since \\(-5 \\cdot 3 = 15\\).\nThis is called reflexivity, and we say that \\(\\mid\\) is reflexive because it satisfies this property.\nAnother important note about the “divides” relation is that to say “\\(a\\) divides \\(b\\)” is not the same as saying “\\(b/a\\) is an integer.” The latter is a statement about the result of applying the division binary operation to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).1 The number \\(0\\) is what primarily causes issues here: “\\(0\\) divides \\(0\\)” is true, since \\(0 \\cdot q = 0\\) for any number \\(q\\). Meanwhile, \\(0/0\\) is undefined.\nThis property is called transitivity, and we say that \\(\\mid\\) is a transitive relation on the integers.\nFor all that follows, we denote by \\(\\mathbb{N}\\) the natural numbers, consisting of the non-negative integers \\(0, 1, 2, \\dots\\). Take special care that we are including zero in this set.2 It will soon be apparent why we do this.\nThis property is known as antisymmetry, and we say that \\(\\mid\\) is an antisymmetric relation on \\(\\mathbb{N}\\).",

The first equation tells us that \\(b (1 - k_1 k_2) = 0\\). Then either \\(b = 0\\) or \\(k_1 = k_2 = 1\\).\nIf \\(b = 0\\), then because \\(a k_1 = b\\) we have either \\(a = 0\\) (and thus \\(a = b\\)), or we have \\(k_1 = 0\\).
