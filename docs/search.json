    "text": "2.1 The “Divides” Relation\nFor example, \\(3\\) divides \\(6\\) since \\(3 \\cdot 2 = 6\\), and \\(-5\\) divides \\(15\\) since \\(-5 \\cdot 3 = 15\\).\nThis is called reflexivity, and we say that \\(\\mid\\) is reflexive because it satisfies this property.\nAnother important note about the “divides” relation is that to say “\\(a\\) divides \\(b\\)” is not the same as saying “\\(b/a\\) is an integer.” The latter is a statement about the result of applying the division binary operation to \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).1 The number \\(0\\) is what primarily causes issues here: “\\(0\\) divides \\(0\\)” is true, since \\(0 \\cdot q = 0\\) for any number \\(q\\). Meanwhile, \\(0/0\\) is undefined.\nThis property is known as antisymmetry, and we say that \\(\\mid\\) is an antisymmetric relation on \\(\\mathbb{N}\\).\nThis property is called transitivity, and we say that \\(\\mid\\) is a transitive relation on the integers.\nFor all that follows, we denote by \\(\\mathbb{N}\\) the natural numbers, consisting of the non-negative integers \\(0, 1, 2, \\dots\\). Take special care that we are including zero in this set.2 It will soon be apparent why we do this.",

    "text": "Definition 2.1 Let \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) be integers. We say \\(m\\) divides \\(n\\), and we write \\(m \\mid n\\) if there exists an integer \\(q\\) such that \\(mq = n\\).\n\n\n\nExercise 2.1 Show that for any integer \\(a\\) we have \\(a \\mid a\\).\n\n\n\nSolution\n\nWe have \\(a \\cdot 1 = a\\), so \\(a\\) satisfies Definition 2.1 with \\(1\\) in place of \\(q\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2.2 Show that if \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are integers, and \\(a \\mid b\\) and \\(b \\mid c\\), then \\(a \\mid c\\).\n\n\n\nSolution\n\nIf \\(a \\mid b\\), then there exists an integer \\(k_1\\) such that \\(a k_1 = b\\). If \\(b \\mid c\\), then there exists an integer \\(k_2\\) such that \\(b k_2 = c\\). Hence, \\(a (k_1 k_2) = (a k_1) k_2 = b k_2 = c\\). So \\(a\\) divides \\(c\\) with \\(k_1 k_2\\) in place of \\(q\\) in Definition 2.1.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2.3 Show that for natural numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), if \\(a \\mid b\\) and \\(b \\mid a\\), then \\(a = b\\).3\n\n\n\nSolution\n\nIf \\(a \\mid b\\), then there exists a natural number \\(k_1\\) such that \\(a k_1 = b\\). Similarly, \\(b \\mid a\\) implies there exists a natural number \\(k_2\\) such that \\(b k_2 = a\\). Hence, \\(b = a k_1 = b k_1 k_2\\). We may similarly show that \\(a = k_1 k_2 a\\). The first equation tells us that \\(b (1 - k_1 k_2) = 0\\). Then either \\(b = 0\\) or \\(k_1 = k_2 = 1\\).\nIf \\(b = 0\\), then because \\(a k_1 = b\\) we have either \\(a = 0\\) (and thus \\(a = b\\)), or we have \\(k_1 = 0\\). This would imply that \\(a = k_1 k_2 a = 0 \\cdot k_2 a = 0\\). So \\(a = b = 0\\).\nIf \\(b \\neq 0\\) (i.e., \\(k_1 = k_2 = 1\\)), then certainly \\(a = 1 \\cdot a = a k_1 = b\\). In either case, \\(a = b\\).\n\n\nExercise 2.4 Give an example of a pair of integers for which \\(a \\mid b\\) and \\(b \\mid a\\), yet \\(a \\neq b\\).",

    "text": "2.2 Defining Posets\nWe will use \\(\\preccurlyeq\\) to denote an arbitrary partial order. A pair \\((X, \\preccurlyeq)\\) consisting of the set \\(X\\) equipped with a partial order relation \\(\\preccurlyeq\\) on \\(X\\) is called a partially ordered set or poset. The set \\((\\mathbb{N}, \\mid)\\) is a poset, since we verified that \\(\\mid\\) is reflexive, transitive, and antisymmetric on \\(\\mathbb{N}\\). On the other hand, \\((\\mathbb{Z}, \\mid)\\) is not a poset, since \\(\\mid\\) is not antisymmetric if we allow both positive and negative integers (see Exercise 2.4).\n\nExercise 2.5 Show that the following are posets:\n\n\\((\\mathbb{Z}, \\leq)\\).\nFor an arbitrary set \\(X\\), \\((\\mathscr{P}(X), \\subseteq)\\), where \\(\\mathscr{P}(X)\\) is the power set of \\(X\\), the set of all of its subsets.\n\n\nThe following are more advanced examples, and may be skipped.\n\nExercise 2.6 Show that the following are posets:\n\nFor an arbitrary group \\(G\\), \\((\\mathscr{A}(G), \\leq)\\) where the set \\(\\mathscr{A}(G)\\) consists of the subgroups of \\(G\\) and \\(\\leq\\) is the “subgroup” relation.\nFor a path-connected, locally path-connected, semilocally simply-connected topological space \\(X\\) with a distinguished basepoint \\(x_0 \\in X\\), the set of basepoint-preserving isomorphism classes of path-connected covering spaces \\(p : (\\tilde{X}, \\tilde{x}_0 \\to (X, x_0)\\) is a poset under the relation: \\((\\tilde{X}_1, \\tilde{x}_1) \\preccurlyeq (\\tilde{X}_2, \\tilde{x}_2)\\) if and only if there exists a basepoint-preserving covering map \\(f : \\tilde{X}_2 \\to \\tilde{X}_1\\) such that \\(p_1 \\circ f = p_2\\) (this can be rephrased less precisely by saying \\(X_2\\) is a covering of \\(X_1\\)) (Hatcher 2002, 68).\nThe field extensions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHatcher, Allen. 2002.
