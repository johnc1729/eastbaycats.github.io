For all that follows, we denote by \\(\\mathbb{N}\\) the natural numbers, consisting of the non-negative integers \\(0, 1, 2, \\dots\\). Take special care to notice that we are including zero in this set.1 It will soon be apparent why we do this.\nAnother important note about the divides relation",
